WEEK 5 DEVELOPMENT LOG – CNN DETECTOR & INFERENCE
--------------------------------------------------

1. ResNet-18 CNN Detector
   - Implemented src/cnn_resnet.py to train a deep model for AI-generated
     image detection.
   - Used torchvision ResNet-18 with an ImageNet-pretrained backbone and
     replaced the final fully-connected layer with a 2-class head.
   - Training setup:
       * Train / test split: data/raw/train and data/raw/test
         (real vs fake folders).
       * Data augmentation: Resize(256), RandomResizedCrop(224),
         RandomHorizontalFlip, normalization with ImageNet mean/std.
       * Optimizer: Adam (lr = 1e-4).
       * Loss: CrossEntropyLoss.
       * Epochs: 15, batch size: 32.
   - Results:
       * Best test accuracy: ~0.8564.
       * Training accuracy approaches ~0.98–0.99, indicating some
         overfitting but still good generalization on the held-out test set.
   - Saved the best model checkpoint to:
       results/models/resnet18_best.pth
   - Logged per-epoch metrics to:
       results/week5_cnn_resnet18_metrics.csv

2. CNN Inference Script (Single-Image Prediction)
   - Implemented src/predict_cnn.py to enable single-image inference.
   - The script:
       * Reads class order from data/raw/train (['fake', 'real']).
       * Loads the trained ResNet-18 weights from
         results/models/resnet18_best.pth.
       * Applies the same preprocessing as the test pipeline
         (Resize → CenterCrop → Normalize).
       * Outputs the predicted label and softmax probabilities.
   - Example usage:
       python src/predict_cnn.py --image data/raw/test/fake/<filename>.jpg
       python src/predict_cnn.py --image data/raw/test/real/<filename>.jpg
   - Example results:
       * Fake test image:
           - Prediction: FAKE, confidence ≈ 0.9997
       * Real test image:
           - Prediction: REAL, confidence ≈ 1.0000
   - This script effectively turns the project into a tool that can
     classify new images (within the same domain) as AI-generated or real.

3. Comparison to Classical Baselines
   - Classical + DCT SVM baseline:
       * Test accuracy ≈ 0.71
   - ResNet-18 CNN:
       * Best test accuracy ≈ 0.8564
   - Conclusion:
       * The CNN significantly outperforms the classical feature-based
         models, confirming the benefit of end-to-end deep learning for
         this detection task.
