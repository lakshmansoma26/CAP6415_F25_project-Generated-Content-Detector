WEEK 4 DEVELOPMENT LOG – ROBUSTNESS EVALUATION


1. Robustness Evaluation Script
   - Implemented src/robustness.py to evaluate how the classical
     DCT-augmented detector behaves under common real-world distortions.
   - The script:
       - Trains Logistic Regression and Linear SVM on CLEAN train features
         (classical + DCT, 107-D).
       - Evaluates both models on multiple distorted versions of the test set.
       - Saves accuracies for each distortion scenario to
         results/week4_robustness.csv.

2. Distortion Scenarios
   - Tested the following perturbations applied only to test images:
       * clean: no distortion.
       * jpeg_q50: JPEG compression with quality = 50.
       * jpeg_q30: JPEG compression with quality = 30.
       * blur_5: Gaussian blur with ksize = 5.
       * blur_9: Gaussian blur with ksize = 9.
       * noise_10: Additive Gaussian noise with σ = 10.
       * noise_20: Additive Gaussian noise with σ = 20.

3. Quantitative Results (Test Set, 195 Images)
   - Summary of observed accuracies:
       * clean:
           - LR ≈ 0.677
           - SVM ≈ 0.708
       * jpeg_q50:
           - LR ≈ 0.667
           - SVM ≈ 0.656
       * jpeg_q30:
           - LR ≈ 0.662
           - SVM ≈ 0.646
       * blur_5:
           - LR ≈ 0.677
           - SVM ≈ 0.667
       * blur_9:
           - LR ≈ 0.682
           - SVM ≈ 0.672
       * noise_10:
           - LR ≈ 0.574
           - SVM ≈ 0.590
       * noise_20:
           - LR ≈ 0.569
           - SVM ≈ 0.574

4. Observations
   - JPEG Compression:
       * Moderate compression (Q=50,30) introduces only a small drop in
         accuracy compared to the clean case, indicating some robustness
         to JPEG artifacts.
   - Blur:
       * Gaussian blur with k=5 and k=9 has limited impact on performance;
         accuracy remains similar to the clean case. This suggests that
         color histograms and DCT statistics are reasonably stable under
         mild blurring.
   - Noise:
       * Additive Gaussian noise dramatically reduces accuracy for both
         LR and SVM, down to ~0.57–0.59. This highlights that noise is a
         major weakness for the current classical + DCT detector.

5. Next Steps
   - Use these robustness results as a baseline for comparison once a
     CNN-based detector (ResNet-18) is implemented.
   - Investigate whether CNN features and/or hybrid CNN + forensic
     models can improve robustness, particularly against noise.
