WEEK 1 LOG of Generated Content Detector

1. Repository Setup
   - Created public GitHub repository:
     CAP6415_F25_project-Generated-Content-Detector
   - Setting up initial folder structure as:
     data/, src/, results/, logs/.

2. Project Definition
   - Finalized project: Generated Content Detector.
   - Defined goals:
     * Classifying real vs AI-generated images.
     * Study cross-generator generalization which train on one generator, test on another.
     * Evaluate robustness to compression, blur, and noise.
   - The initial abstract and description is written in README.md.

3. Environment & Dependencies
   - Installed:
     * Python 3.10+
     * PyTorch and Torchvision
     * OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Pillow
   - Created the requirements.txt file with core dependencies in it.

4. Dataset Research
   - Began exploring potential datasets but have not finalized one yet.
   - Reviewed several public options for real vs AI-generated images:
     * ArtiFact (Kaggle) – labeled real and synthetic images from multiple generators.
     * GenImage benchmark – large-scale diffusion/GAN-generated image dataset.
     * Real image sources for authentic samples.

5. Planning for Week 2
   - What to do for next week:
     * Implement basic data loader in src/data_loader.py.
     * Implement classical-feature baseline in src/classical_baseline.py:
       - Color histograms, edge-based features, simple frequency features.
     * Run first baseline experiment and log initial accuracy and confusion matrix.

Summary:
Week 1 focused on setting up the repository on fau id, defining the project scope and goals, preparing the environment for the project, and researching datasets. 
No models were trained yet; the emphasis was on infrastructure and planning to ensure smoother progress in later weeks.
